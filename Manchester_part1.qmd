## Good to know

### What this workshop is...

- Second of a series of introductory workshops on using weights and survey design information to compute accurate population estimates
- Will be used to design asynchronous material
- Practical, everyday users-oriented
- Plain English: (almost) no formula
- New approach: community of practice

### And isn't

- A full course on complex survey design/statistical inference
- An introduction to R / Stata
- An introduction to advanced topics of statistical inference
- Quick, easy to use recipes for computing weighted estimates 

tl;dr: some basic degree of familiarity with the topic is assumed

## Samples and sampling 
- Survey design:  strategies used to collect samples. 
- Sample members can either be selected:

    - purposively, for example when internet users are self-selecting to take part in  an online poll
    - randomly (all members of the target population have a non-zero chance of selection), AKA *probability sampling*. 
    
- The process of deriving population estimates   from a sample is called *inference*


## Probability samples and sampling 

- *Random sampling* minimises the risk of obtaining unrepresentative samples and biased population estimates:

  - ie when certain groups are under represented or  excluded.

- *Simple  random sampling* - directly drawing members of the target population   - is considered  the best way to  conduct RS and avoid bias... 

- ... But difficult to achieve:  need a  list of the population (national  register).   
- ... Not necessarily  optimal:
  
    - when some groups have different probabilities of taking part in surveys than others
    - when smaller groups need to be over-represented to obtain more reliable and precise statistics.
    - costly, especially in low population density areas

## The survey design problem

- Designing surveys entails striking a balance between:

  - representativeness and precision (ie sample size)...
  - while keeping costs down (surveys are expensive!). 

- Large scale social surveys  tend to rely on  techniques   better at striking this balance than SRS

  - To ensure correct representation of each country of the UK (ie by  drawing  separate samples for each one of them). 
  - To improve the precision of estimates estimates for  certain groups, for example ethnic minorities, and these need adequate sample size.

- In effect SRS is more of a theoretical possibility than a real world sampling technique for  social surveys 
    - *Complex sample design* --> everything else - perhaps not the best label!


## Common 'complex'  sampling techniques

- **Clustering**

  - Consists in dividing the population into groups  *as internally heterogeneous as possible* - ie ‘mini populations’, some of which are then randomly drawn while others are left out. 
  - Comes together with *multistage sampling*:  i.e. drawing sample units in several steps rather than all at once

- **Stratifying** also consists in dividing the population into groups according to predetermined characteristics, but this time  units are drawn from all of them 

- **Adjusting sampling proportion** ie sampling more/less than the rest of the population for some groups

## The UK context

- No sampling frame ie national register of the population
- The closest to it (in Great-Britain)  is Royal Mail's Postcode Address File: i.e. a  structured list of addresses 
- For Northern Ireland the most commonly used is the Land and Property Services Agency’s (LPSA). 
- We cannot use the PAF to directly draw samples of households or individuals, as their number at each address is not know.

- However, the  structure of the PAF easily enables geographical clustering of surveys. Addresses, or ’delivery points’ cluster into larger units
- Also addresses receiving   unusually large amounts of mail - likely to be businesses or institutions can be filtered out 

## Example
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
  - The post code M13 9PL is embedded within the the M13 ‘postcode district’ and the M13 9 ‘postcode sector’. 
  - Survey designs often use either postcode sectors or districts as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) to reduce fieldwork costs and time.

## Example
The previous figure illustrates  clustering with four districts:  

- The  higher level clusters, i.e. those at which the first random draw happened, are  the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). 
- Districts 1 and 4 have been selected to be in the sample. 
- A second stage of sampling follows:  addresses are sampled from within the two selected districts
- Subsequent drawing of either: 

    - further clusters, for example, households or   
    - final individual sample members 
- In large scale surveys the PSUs are often geographical areas. 


## Household level clustering - 1  
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Arises in some  large-scale household surveys such as the Labour Force Survey. 
- Imagine:

  - Estimating the proportion of individuals born abroad... 
  - ... from a population of 100 people  in 50 households. 
  - ... if  sampling one in ten household
- Those  born abroad are more likely to live together ‘clustered’ within households, than spread randomly. 
- Some households are  wholly overseas born, some mixed and most wholly UK born. 

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
e.g. 
```
Household 1: 1 UK born individuals 
Household 2: 3 UK born 
Household 3: 2 Overseas born 
Household 4: 6 UK born 
Household 5: 1 Overseas born, 1 UK born 
Household 6: 2 UK born 
Household 7: 1 UK born 
Household 8: 1 UK born 
Household 9: 5 Overseas born 
Household 10: 3 UK born 
```
:::

## Household level clustering - 2 
And so on…

- Clustering within households means that if we draw  one in ten of the households for our sample we might expect the sample to be less accurate in predicting the proportion of our population who were born outside the UK than if we had sampled individuals at random.

- Clustering comes at the cost of making the sample coarser - as  we shrink the size of the population from which it is drawn - reducing its diversity - which in turn makes the estimates draw from it less precise. 

## Stratification

- This time the population is divided into groups, according to some characteristics, and a sample of units is selected from *each* strata. 
- Example: grouping addresses into three  'bands' of   area deprivation  
- Stratified sampling ensures that the sample includes a certain proportion of units from the selected groups that may have been missed otherwise. 
- Unlike clusters, strata are meant to be as internally homogeneous as possible
- Stratification tends to increases the precision of  estimates, by improving the number of units from  potentially less represented or harder to reach groups.



## An example of stratified sampling 
![](pics/strata.png){.nostretch width="80%" fig-align="center"}


- The population is divided into four strata: North, South, East and West. 
- Within each strata five sampling units (ie addresses) are selected.

## Stratification

- UK surveys are usually stratified: 

    - geographically (e.g. Government Office Regions); 
    - socio-economic  characteristics (occupations)   
    - or demography (e.g. proportion of people who are pensioners in areas). 

- Such information  is usually obtained from (area-level) Census data.


## Sampling fraction

- In simple random sampling, each element drawn from the sampling frame has an equal selection probability. 

- In stratified sampling, *proportionate stratification* is when  the same sampling fraction is used across all strata:
  
    - The number of units sampled is proportional to the size of a stratum

- *Disproportionate stratification* means that   the sampling fraction varies across strata. 

  - This is  is useful when a group of interest is small, i.e. less populated areas or ethnic minority groups. 

- Disproportionate sampling  results in some groups being over-represented in the sample:

  - Adjustments are needed before we can analyse the data.


## One slide summary
- There is no such thing as a sampling frame - a list of all UK residents to pick from
- Even if there were one, some people are known to  less easy to reach and/or less likely to take part in survey than others. 
- Most UK social surveys rely on  *multi-stage clustering and stratification*, alongside *sampling proportionate* to size 
- These strike a compromise between issues such as tackling non response, unequal probability of selection, improving the representativeness of hard to reach groups while keeping fieldwork costs down.
