## Plan
 <!-- If rendering of this script returns an error  --> 
 <!-- run quarto add shafayetShafee/reveal-header
 <!-- In the project  directory -->
-   Three sessions:

  1. Survey design: a refresher

  2. Inference in theory and practice 

  **3.  R and Stata examples**

## This session  

1.  R vs Stata speak
2.  Means, proportions, CI
3.  When survey design variables are not present

##  Data and software requirements

- An up to date  copy of R (with the `dplyr`,  `haven`,  `survey` and `Hmisc` packages installed) or Stata  
- An active account with the UK Data Service (for downloading the datasets)
- We will  use data from:

  - The  [2017 British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA)](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8450)[@NatCen2024]
  
  - The [April-June 2022 Quarterly Labour Force Survey](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8999#!/access-data)[@ONS2025]
  



# 1.  R vs Stata speak
## Survey design estimation in R
- The R *Survey* package [@Lumley2024] provides a comprehensive set of functions for computing  point and variance estimates from survey data.  

- Overall logic:
  - Install the `survey` packages and load it into memory
  - Declare the survey design: i.e. create a `svydesign` object from the  data
  
```
         mydata.s<-svydesign(id=~psu_var,
                             strata=~strata_var, 
                             weights=weight_var,
                             mydata)`
```      

  - Compute estimates with survey-specific functions: 
  
    - `svymean(myvar,mydata.s)`
    - `svytab(myvar,mydata.s)`
   ...

## Command-based weighting in R

- R  does not provide a unified set of functions for computing command-based weighted estimates. 
- Implementation of weighting may vary between packages, but algorithms are usually  described in detail in the package documentation. 
- Base R  has only one weight-aware function: `weighted.mean()`
- Some R packages offer a more comprehensive set of weighted estimation functions:

  - `Hmisc`: `wtd.mean()`, `wtd.var()`, `wtd.quantile()`
  - `summarytools`: `descr()`, `freq()`

- Confidence intervals and standard errors still have to be computed manually

## Survey design in Stata

- Stata provides comprehensive support for computing survey design-informed  estimates from survey data
- Implementation logic similar to R:

  - Declare the survey design using `svyset`
  
    - `svyset id=psu_var [pweights=weight_var],strata(strata_var)`
    
  - Subsequently use `svy:` - prefixed commands for estimation:
  
    - `svy:mean myvar`, `svy:tab myvar` etc...

## Stata command-based weighting  - 1

- Users may add survey weights to most Stata estimation commands, or use survey-specific commands. The latter is recommended. 

- Stata distinguishes between four kinds of (dealing with) weights: 

  - frequency weights (`fweight`), 
  - analytical weights (`aweight`), 
  - importance weights (`iweight`) and 
  - probability weights (`pweight`). 

- These mostly differ in the way variance standard is computed 


## Stata command-based weighting  - 2

- Survey weights should be treated as *probability weights* or `pw`. 
.
- Command-based weighting (i.e. not using survey design functions) in Stata consists in the weighting variables being specified between square brackets. 

    - `stata_command myvar [pw=weight_var]`

- Common estimation commands, such as `summarise` or `tab` do not allow using `pw`

  - $\longrightarrow$ This is to nudge users to rely on the `svy:` commands instead

- Some prefer to  specify the wrong kind of weighting function  instead (`fw` or `aw`) in order to avoid using the survey design functions. You may get the correct point estimates, but your variance/standard errors are likely to be incorrect.  

  - **Do this at your own risk!**

## What about longitudinal weights?

- Longitudinal data can either be analysed:

  - Cross-sectionaly (i.e. a single wave of data) $\longrightarrow$ cross-sectional weights
  - Longitudinally (i.e. two or more waves of data) $\longrightarrow$ check your data documentation for the suitable weights:
  
    - Longitudinal weights may have been computed to account for attrition between two waves only
    - ... Or several of them...
    - The idea is to use the longitudinal weights from the last wave of data being used 
  
- From a software point of view, the above survey estimation functions apply to longitudinal data (with the correct weights!)  

# 2.  Means, <br>proportions, <br> confidence intervals


## Identifying the survey design 

We first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the 2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that comes together with the data under the `mrdoc/pdf` folder. 

**Question 1**

- What is the design that was used in this survey 

  - How many stages were there, and what were the population units sampled?
  - What were the primary sampling units; the strata (if relevant)?
  
## Answer to question 1

- The 2017 BSA is a three stage stratified random survey, with postcode sectors, adresses and individuals as the units selected at each stage. 

- Primary sampling units were furthermore stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. 

- Sampling fraction (or proportion) was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (ie number of addresses)


## Finding  the survey design variables 

Now that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was designed, we can to try and identify the design 
variables available in the dataset. The information can usually be found in the user manual or the data dictionary available under `mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip` The file may need to be decompressed  separately.

**Question 2**

- What survey design variables are available? 
- Are there any that are missing -- if so which ones? 
- What is the name of the weights variables?

## Q2 Answers

- From the Data Dictionary it appears that:

  - the primary sampling units (sub regions) are identified bySpoint
  - the strata byStratID 
  - the weights variable is WtFactor. 

- Addresses are not provided but could be approximated with a household identifier.
- Searching directly from within R or Stata may also be an option

## Preparing the data - R  

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)                                                              ### Data manipulation functions
library(haven)                                                              ### Importing stata/SPSS files
library(Hmisc)                                                              ### Extra statistical functions
library(survey)                                                             ### Survey design functions
library(ggplot2)
setwd("~/OneDrive/trainings/Inference_workshops/Manchester_Nov24/")         ### Edit as appropriate
datadir<-"~/Data/"                                                          ### Edit as appropriate
bsa17<-read_dta(paste0(datadir,"bsa/UKDA-8450-stata/bsa2017_for_ukda.dta")) ### Importing Stata format dataset
dim(bsa17)                                                                  ### Check the dataset

### You can also use `View()`
```

- We can now specify the survey design using:

  - `Spoint` as Primary Sampling Unit ids, 
  - `StratID` as strata ids, 
  - `WtFactor` as weights. 

##  Specifying the survey design in R (1)

- We create a `svydesign` object, i.e. a survey design informed copy of the data, which will be used for  subsequent estimation.

```{r 5_2}
bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint, 
                   strata=~StratID, 
                   weights=~WtFactor,
                   data=bsa17)        ### Specifying the survey design
class(bsa17.s)                        ### Examining the svydesign object                                        
```
##  Specifying the survey design in R (2)

- We can inspect   the content of `bsa17.s`. Beware, the output is really large!

```{r 5_21}
summary(bsa17.s)                      ### ... And looking at its content

```

## Mean age and its 95% CI
- We can now produce a first set of estimates using the  survey design information. We begin with the mean age of respondents. 

- We will need to use `svymean()`
```{r mean}
svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s)
```
 By default  `svymean()` computes the standard error of the mean. We need to  
 embed it within `confint()` in order to get a confidence interval. 

```{r 5_3}
confint(                                  ### Computing the confidence interval...
  svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s)                 ### And the mean
  )                   
```
- For a slightly nicer output:
```{r nicer1}
#| code-fold: true
round(                                    ### Rounding the results to one decimal point
  c(
    svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s),              ### Computing the mean...
    confint(svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s))      ### And its 95% CI
    ),
  1) 
```
## Question 3
- What would be the consequences of:

  - weighing but not accounting for the sample design; 
  - neither using  weights or accounting for the sample design?

- When: 
  - inferring the mean age in the population?
  - computing the uncertainty  of this  estimate? 

## Q. 3 answer (1): command-based weighting

- We need to compute means and CI separately: 

```{r}
a.m<-wtd.mean(                               ### Weighted mean function from the
  bsa17$RAgeE,                               ### Hmisc package
  bsa17$WtFactor,
  normwt = T)                                ### Option specific to survey weights  

### Computation of the standard error by hand...
a.se<-sqrt(
          wtd.var(bsa17$RAgeE,               ### ... using the weighted variance function from Hmisc
                  bsa17$WtFactor,
                  normwt = T)
          )/
       sqrt(
         nrow(bsa17)                         ### ... shortcut to sample size
         )

c(a.m,                                       ### Concatenating the mean..
  a.m-1.96*a.se,                             ### ... the lower bound of the CI
  a.m+1.96*a.se)                             ### ... and the higher bound
```

 
## Q. 3 answer (2):  unweighted estimates


```{r}
ua.m<-mean(bsa17$RAgeE)                     ### mean() function from R Base
  
ua.se<-sd(bsa17$RAgeE)/                     ### ... standard errors
      sqrt(nrow(bsa17))    ##

c(ua.m,                                     ### and putting it all together
  ua.m-1.96*ua.se,
  ua.m+1.96*ua.se
  )

```

## Question 3 answer: Summary

- Not using weights results in  overestimating the mean age in the population (of those aged 18+) by about 4 years. 
- This might be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take part to surveys. 
- Using command-based weighting does not alter the value of the estimated population mean when compared with SD informed estimates...
- ... but would lead us to overestimating the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of our estimate -- by about plus or minus 3 months. 


## Computing a proportion and its 95% confidence interval
- We can similarly estimate the distribution of a categorical variable in the population by estimating proportions (or percentages)
- Let's look at the proportion of people who declare that they are interested in politics. 
- This is the `Politics` variable in the BSA. 
- It has five categories ranging from 1: 'A great deal' to 5: 'Not at all'.
- We could recode together  1 and 2, i.e. `A great deal` and `quite a lot` into `Significantly`, but  here we will directly select the relevant values on the fly as this is allowed by R. 

## Let's explore the variable
- Phrasing of the question:

```{r 5_4_1} 
attr(bsa17$Politics,"label")     
```


- Sample distribution

```{r 5_4_3}
table(
  droplevels(                                    ### We are using droplevels() 
             as_factor(bsa17$Politics, "both")   ### in order to hide categories
             )                                   ### ... without any observations
  ) 
``` 

##
- Let's infer the percentage of those who were interested in politics  in 2017

```{r 5_5}
  round(100*
    prop.table(
      svytable(~(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s)
      ),1)
```


```{r 5_5.1}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Alternative:"

bsa17$PolC<-as.factor(ifelse(bsa17$Politics==1 | bsa17$Politics==2, "Interested", "Not so much") )
bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint, 
                   strata=~StratID, 
                   weights=~WtFactor,
                   data=bsa17)        

  round(100*
    prop.table(
      svytable(~(PolC),bsa17.s)
      ),1)


```

- Let us now estimate the confidence intervals for  these proportions.  Software like Stata or SPSS  usually doesn't  show us  what is happening under the bonnet.  R requires more coding, but also enables us to better understand what we are actually estimating. 

- Confidence intervals for proportions of categorical variables are in fact  computed as a sequence of binomial/dichotomic estimations -- i.e. one for each category. 

##
- In R we  specify this via `svyciprop()` and `I()`:

  - The former computes the proportion and its confidence interval (by default 95%)...
  - ...  the latter allows us to define the category of interest of a polytomous variable.
  - As before, we could have used a recoded dichotomic variable instead

```{r 5_6_1}
p<-svyciprop(
            ~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),
            bsa17.s)
p
```                     

- A neater version:

```{r 5_6_2}
round(100*
        c("% interested"= p[[1]],                                          ### Extracts the point estimate
          "95% CI - LB"=attr(p,"ci")[[1]],"95% CI - UB"=attr(p,"ci")[[2]]  ### Extracts the CI
          ),1 
      )
```

## Question 4
- What is the proportion of respondents aged 17-34 in the sample, as well as its 95% confidence interval? 

  - You can use `RAgecat5`

## Answer
- The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is: 

```{r} 
a<-svyciprop(~I(RAgecat5 == 1),
              bsa17.s)
a
round(
  100*a[1],
     1)
```

and its 95% confidence interval:                 

```{r} 
round(
    100*
    confint(a),  ### Another way of extracting CI from svyciprop objects
    1)
```


## Computing domain estimates
- Computing estimates for subpopulations adds a layer of complexity to what we have seen so far. 
- Weights are usually  designed to make the  full  sample representative of the population
- If we computed estimates  for a subpopulation only: 

    - this would amount to  using a fraction of these weights 
    - and may alter the accuracy of our estimates. 
- It is instead recommended to use commands that take into account the entire distribution of the weights.

    - The R command that does this is `svyby()`

## Computing domain estimates in R

- Say we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by Government Office Regions
- We need to specify:

  - The outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: i.e. `RAgeE`
  - The grouping variable(s) `GOR_ID`
  - The estimation function we are going to use here: `svymean()`
  - And the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed i.e. standard errors or confidence interval  


## Output

```{r 5.7}
d<-      svyby(~RAgeE,               ### Outcome variable
             by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),  ### Subpopulations
             svymean,                ### Estimation function
             design=bsa17.s,
             vartype = "ci")         ### CI or SE 
round(d[-1],1)
```

We used `[-1]` above  to remove the column with region names from the results, so that we could round the estimates  without getting an error.

## Interpretation
- The population in  London is among the youngest in the country whereas those in the South West are among the oldest 
- This is likely to be statistically significant as their  95% CI do not overlap. 
- The same cannot be said of differences between London and the South East, as the CIs partially overlap.

## Proportions

- The approach for proportion is similar: i.e. specify categories of interest, for example respondents aged 17-34, and replace `svymean` by `svyciprop`.

```{r 5.8}

c<-svyby(~I(RAgecat5==1),
            by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),
            svyciprop,
            design=bsa17.s,
            vartype = "ci")

round(100*c[-1],1)
```

## Visualising CIs
Let's now plot this output:

```{r 5.8.1}
#| output: asis
ggplot(c, aes(x = `I(RAgecat5 == 1)`, y = rownames(c))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#ff9800") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = ci_l, xmax = ci_u), width = 0.1, color = "#ff9800") +
  labs(
    title = "% aged 17-34 by region",
    y = "Government Office Region",
    x = "% Aged between 17 and 34'"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```


## Question 5
- What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people significantly interested in politics in the North East? 
- Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? 
- What is the region of the UK for which the estimates are likely to be least precise?

## Q5 Answer (1)
Proportion of those interested in politics by region:
```{r 5.8.2}

c<-svyby(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),
            by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),
            svyciprop,
            design=bsa17.s,
            vartype = "ci")

round(100*c[-1],1)
```


## Plotting CIs
Let's now plot this output:

```{r 5.8.3}
#| output: asis
ggplot(c, aes(x = `I(Politics == 1 | Politics == 2)`, y = rownames(c))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#ff9800") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = ci_l, xmax = ci_u), width = 0.1, color = "#ff9800") +
  labs(
    title = "% interested in politics by region",
    y = "Government Office Region",
    x = "% Interested in politics 'a great deal'or 'quite a lot'"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```


## Question 5: Answer

- The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people significantly   interested in politics in the North East is  `r round(100*as.numeric(c[1,3:4]),1)`. 
- By contrast, it is  `r round(100*as.numeric(c[7,3:4]),1)` in London. 
- The region with the lowest precision of estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with more than   20  percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.



## Question 6
- Using interest in politics as before, and three category age `RAgecat5`: 
- Produce a table showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in politics by age group and gender
- Assess whether the age difference in interest for politics is similar for each gender.
- Is it fair to say that men aged under 35 are more likely to declare being  interested  in politics  than women aged 55 and above?

## Question 6 - Answer

```{r 6.1}
round(
      100*
        svyby(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),
              by=~as_factor(RAgecat5)+as_factor(Rsex),
              svyciprop,
              design=bsa17.s,
              vartype = "ci")[c(-8,-4),c(-2,-1)],1)
``` 
- Males and females aged 55+ tend to be more involved in politics than those who are younger.

- CIs for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlap; it is unlikely that they  differ significantly  in the population.

## Domain estimation - unresolved questions

- Unique PSUs within strata
- R vs Stata
- Results may differ 
- Broader issue: small subpopulations and  design-based estimation

# 3. Dealing with  the absence of survey design variables 

##  Estimating employment by region 
- We are using the Safeguarded Quarterly Labour Force Survey, April-July 2022. 
- As a rule, EUL versions of the LFS do not include survey  design variables. 
- The LFS   come with  two weighting variables:
  - `pwt22` for estimation with the whole sample
  - `piwt22` for   earnings estimation of respondents  in employment (also accounting for  the high level of non response for the earnings variables) 

- Estimation without  accounting for sample design is  likely be biased and should be reported as such including warnings, even if its nature (over or underestimation) and size are not known. 

##
- An alternative is to look for design factors tables published by the data producer which could be used to correct for the bias.

- The Office for National Statistics regularly publishes Deft tables for the LFS, but only  for their headline statistics.

## Regional employment rates using R

- Let's first produce uncorrected estimates of the regional population.
- We will still use the survey design functions, but declare a SRS design 

```{r  5.9}
lfs<-read_dta(
              (paste0(
                datadir,
                "lfs/UKDA-8999-stata/lfsp_aj22_eul_pwt22.dta"
                )
               )
              )%>%
     select(PWT22,PIWT22,GOVTOF2,URESMC,ILODEFR)

table(as_factor(lfs$GOVTOF2))
```

##
For some reason, the ONS use a distinct category for Merseyside, but not the `GOVTOF` variable in our dataset. We will correct this using another, more detailed region variable: `URESMC`.

```{r 5.10}
lfs<-lfs%>%
     mutate(
            govtof=ifelse(URESMC==15,3,GOVTOF2)
            )        # Identifying Merseyside using URESMC

lfs$govtof.f<-as.ordered(lfs$govtof)                           # Converting into factor
levels(lfs$govtof.f)<-c(names(attr((lfs$GOVTOF2),"labels")[3:4]),
                        "Merseyside",
                        names(attr((lfs$GOVTOF2),"labels")[5:14])) # Adding factor levels from existing labels
table(lfs$govtof.f)
```


##
Let us now examine  the confidence intervals for the percentage of persons in employment:

```{r 5.12}
lfs.s<-svydesign(ids=~1,weights=~PWT22,data=lfs) 
d<-      svyby(~I(ILODEFR==1),
               by=~govtof.f,
               svyciprop,
               vartype="se",
               design=lfs.s)

df<-100*data.frame(d[-1])
names(df)<-c("Empl.","SE")
df["Low.1"]<-round(df$Empl.-(1.96*df$SE),1)
df["High.1"]<-round(df$Empl.+(1.96*df$SE),1)
df
```

##
We can now import the design factors from the LFS documentation. This has to be done by hand. 


```{r 5.13}
df$deft<-c(0.8712,1.0857,1.3655,
           1.0051,0.9634,1.0382,
           0.8936,1.3272,0.9677,
           0.9137,1.0012,1.0437,
           0.7113)
df["Low.2"]<-round(df$Empl.-(1.96*df$SE*df$deft),1)
df["High.2"]<-round(df$Empl.+(1.96*df$SE*df$deft),1)

# Cleaning up the labels
#rownames(df)<-substr(rownames(df),9,nchar(rownames(df)))
df
```
In some regions, CI have widened (i.e. London) whereas they have shrunk in others (i.e. the North East)
